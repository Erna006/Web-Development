<h1>Great Big Words</h1>
<h2>by Michael Mark & Tom Chapin</h2>

<p>When I was a little kid,
a "<em class="big">diminutive juvenile</em>," <br>
I liked my folks to read to me,
I was an <em class="big">"eager bibliophile."</em> <br>
Now I love words for how they sound <br>
And how they <em class="big">"communicate."</em> <br>
Perhaps I should explain myself,
that is, <em class="big">"elucidate."</em> <br>
Great big words, I like <em class="big">big</em> words. <br>
Letter by letter, the <em class="bigger">bigger</em> the better <br>
Great big words. La la la la la la la la la la!</p>

            <h2>My First Coding Experience</h2>
            <h6 class="date">Posted on January 15, 2024</h6>
            
            <p>Today I wrote my first HTML code! It was exciting to see how simple text can turn into a real web page. I started with the basic structure of HTML and created a simple page with headings, paragraphs, and links.</p>
            
            <p>At first, it seemed complicated, but after a few hours of practice, I began to understand the logic. The most amazing thing was when I opened my HTML file in a browser and saw my creation come to life!</p>

            <h2>Why I Love Web Development</h2>
            <h6 class="date">Posted on January 22, 2024</h6>
            
            <p>After a week of learning HTML and CSS, I realized why web development is so exciting. You can immediately see the results of your work! Every change in the code instantly changes what you see in the browser.</p>
            
            <p>What I love most about web development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creativity:</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Instant feedback:</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Problem-solving:</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Community:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I started learning CSS and discovered how to make websites beautiful. Colors, fonts, layouts - it's like being an artist and an engineer at the same time!</p>

            <h2>My Goals for This Year</h2>
            <h6 class="date">Posted on January 29, 2024</h6>
            
            <p>As I continue my journey in web development, I've set some goals for this year:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Master HTML and CSS completely</li>
                <li>Learn JavaScript to make interactive websites</li>
                <li>Build at least 10 different projects</li>
                <li>Create my own portfolio website</li>
                <li>Learn about responsive design</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>I believe that consistent practice is the key to success. Every day I try to code for at least an hour, even if it's just small exercises or reading documentation.</p>
            
            <p>The web development community is amazing - there are so many free resources like Khan Academy, freeCodeCamp, and MDN Web Docs. I'm grateful to have access to all this knowledge!</p>
